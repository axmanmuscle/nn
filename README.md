## Neural Networks
This repo is an implementation of a neural network from scratch in C++. This is to serve as a testbed for a whole bunch of stuff. First I want to understand how connected networks work. I can work on derivatives by hand to train.

After that, nonlinear activation functions and things like convolutional layers. Finally I hope to implement some autodiff by myself.

I'll be writing companion posts at [my github.io page.](http://axmanmuscle.github.io)
